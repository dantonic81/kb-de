## Project Setup

- Clone the repo 
- Navigate to the project directory:

      cd path-to-your-cloned-repo

- Build and run the Docker-compose project: 

      make up

_Note: On slower connections, the initial Docker build may take several minutes — now’s a good time for a coffee refill._

_Also, I've provided a working **pgAdmin** service (credentials provided in the .env file), so if you need it, make sure to uncomment it in **docker-compose.yml** before running the following command_

    

    

This will:

- Start the PostgreSQL database (db) and wait for it to become healthy.

- Launch pgadmin (if uncommented) for optional database inspection via a web UI on http://localhost:8080.

- Run the migrate service to apply Alembic migrations and initialize the database schema.

- Start the FastAPI app (api), which exposes endpoints on http://localhost:8000.

- Bring up the Dagster webserver (dagster), available at http://localhost:3000, for monitoring and running pipelines.

- Start the Dagster daemon (dagster-daemon), responsible for executing scheduled jobs and sensors.

Each service is coordinated using **depends_on** conditions to ensure proper startup order, particularly around the health of the database and the completion of migrations.


## Dagster Job Orchestration & Workflow Overview

Dagster UI is available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

- Use the `overview` or `jobs` tab to explore pipeline components.
- Trigger ETL or analytics jobs manually from the UI.
- The Dagster daemon automatically executes scheduled jobs every hour.


**The patient biometrics analysis system comprises four key batch jobs executed in a logical sequence:**

1. Run `simulate_time_series_job` to generate synthetic biometrics data as timestamped CSV files.


2. Run `etl_job` to extract, validate, and load this data into the database (`patients` and `biometrics` tables).


3. Run `aggregate_biometrics_job` to compute hourly summaries and populate the `patient_biometric_hourly_summary` table.


4. Run `trend_analyzer_job` to classify biometric trends and store them in the `biometric_trends` table.


| Job                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `simulate_time_series_job`  | Simulates hourly biometric data (glucose, weight, blood pressure) per patient and writes it to timestamped CSV files for downstream processing.                                       |
| `etl_job`                   | Extracts, validates, and normalizes patient and biometric data from CSV files. Clean data is upserted into a PostgreSQL database, and invalid records are logged for review.          |
| `aggregate_biometrics_job`  | Aggregates biometric readings by patient and hour using statistical summaries. Results are stored in the patient_biometric_hourly_summary table for efficient querying and analysis.  |
| `trend_analyzer_job`        | Analyzes recent biometric patterns (e.g., increasing, stable, volatile), classifies trends for each patient, and stores them in the biometric_trends table.                           |


See [`trend_analyzer_job`](app/analytics/trend_analyzer.py) for implementation of this bonus feature.

## ETL Pipeline

### ETL Flow Description

The ETL pipeline is defined in `app/etl/run_etl.py` and follows this flow:

1. Load source data from `data/` (CSV/JSON).
2. Validate using Pandera schemas.
3. Normalize timestamps, types, units.
4. Store valid records in PostgreSQL.
5. Write invalid records to `etl_output/`.

Run manually with:

    python app/etl/run_etl.py

### Data Validation Rules

Both patient and biometric data go through a validation stage before being processed.

| Field            | Validation Rule                                                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Patient Email    | Must be in a valid email format (`.*@.*\..*`)                           |
| Biometric Values | Must fall within accepted medical ranges (e.g., glucose: 70–200 mg/dL)  |
| Timestamps       | Must be in ISO 8601 format                                              |



### Error Handling

- **Invalid data** → Logged to `etl_output/invalid_*.csv` for review.
- **Missing fields** → Either filled with defaults or rejected depending on context.
- **Outliers** → Marked with `is_outlier=True` for downstream handling.



## Testing (Bonus Feature)

It's recommended to use a separate **virtual environment** when working with this project. While setting up a virtual environment is outside the scope of this document, once it's activated, install the development dependencies:


    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt


Then, to run the full test suite:
   
    make test

or manually:

    pytest tests/


## Cleanup

Once you no longer need these containers running and you no longer need the data either, simply turn the whole thing off by running the following:

    make down

_💡 Note: This will stop and remove the containers, but volumes (e.g., database data) may persist unless explicitly configured otherwise in docker-compose.yml._





## Database Schema

### Overview

The system is centered around patients and their biometric data, including both raw measurements and summarized or analyzed trends. The database schema has been designed with normalization in mind, ensuring data consistency, referential integrity, and analytical flexibility.

### Entity Descriptions

#### 1. Patient

This table stores personal information about each patient.

- Primary Key: id

- Unique Constraint: email

- Relationships:

  - One-to-many with Biometric

  - One-to-many with PatientBiometricHourlySummary

  - One-to-many with BiometricTrend

#### 2. Biometric

Stores raw biometric measurements.

- Primary Key: id

- Foreign Key: patient_id → Patient.id

- Composite Unique Constraint: (patient_id, biometric_type, timestamp)

- Fields allow storing both scalar (e.g., weight, glucose) and compound (e.g., blood pressure systolic/diastolic) values.

#### 3. PatientBiometricHourlySummary

Captures hourly aggregates of biometric data.

- Primary Key: id

- Foreign Key: patient_id → Patient.id

- Composite Unique Constraint: (patient_id, biometric_type, hour_start)

- Aggregated values include min_value, max_value, avg_value, and count.


#### 4. BiometricTrend

Stores analyzed trends derived from biometric data.

- Primary Key: id

- Foreign Key: patient_id → Patient.id

- Composite Unique Constraint: (patient_id, biometric_type)

- trend is a categorical field indicating the nature of biometric changes (e.g., increasing, decreasing, stable).


### Schema Validation

Two Pandera schemas ensure data integrity for incoming data pipelines:

**BiometricSchema:** Ensures valid biometric input with regex pattern checks and biometric type validation.

**PatientSchema:** Enforces presence and type of core patient information fields.


## Analytics Engine (Dagster)

The analytics pipeline is orchestrated by Dagster and runs hourly via the dagster-daemon.


### Workflow Overview:


- Input: Pulls biometric readings from the past hour.

- Processing:

  - Computes min, max, and average values per patient and biometric type.

  - Analyzes trends using moving averages:

    - Classified as improving, stable, or declining.

- Output: Writes results to patient_biometric_hourly_summary table in the database.

    }


## API Schema and Validation Overview

This project uses Pydantic models to define and validate API data structures.

To keep our API data consistent and reliable, we use a system that defines clear rules for the kind of information we accept and return.

We specify what fields are required, what types of data are allowed, and when certain details are necessary. For example, some measurements need extra details only if they belong to a specific category, like blood pressure.

The system automatically checks incoming data against these rules, so incorrect or incomplete information is caught early.

It also formats the data properly when sending it back, making sure things like dates are easy to understand.

This approach helps prevent errors, ensures data quality, and makes the whole API smoother to use and maintain.


## API Documentation


API Documentation is handled by Built-in API Docs (Swagger / ReDoc)


Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs

ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc


## ✅ Functional and Non-Functional Requirements


### Functional Requirements


- Ingest biometric and patient data via ETL

- Expose CRUD API endpoints for patient and biometric data

- Aggregate biometrics hourly per patient

- Analyze trends in patient biometrics (e.g., increasing/decreasing)

- Provide job orchestration and scheduling via Dagster

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Scalability: Batch-processing of large datasets and aggregation jobs

- Resilience: ETL handles missing values, malformed data, and schema violations gracefully

- Observability: Dagster UI provides operational visibility; logs invalid data records

- Maintainability: Modular codebase, use of SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Docker

- Portability: Docker-based deployment with .env for environment separation

- Testability: Structured test suite for unit and integration testing

- Extensibility: Schema and job definitions are adaptable for new sources or metrics


## Key Design Decisions

- **Idempotent ETL** — Retry-safe pipeline to prevent duplicate records.

- **Batch Processing** — Uses pandas for efficient in-memory transformations.

- **Trend Analysis** — Relies on simple moving averages to detect stability or changes.

- **Containerization** — Docker-based architecture for modular and scalable deployment.


## Future Improvements

- **Stream Processing with Kafka/Flink** — for real-time data ingestion and processing to reduce latency adn support event-driven workflows. This will allow for timely anomaly detection and dynamic dashboards.

- **GraphQL API Layer** — Provide more flexible, client-driven queries to reduce over-fetching and under-fetching of data, improving client performance and usability.

- **Anomaly Detection using ML** — Integrate machine learning models to automatically detect outliers in biometric data, improving clinical insights and alerting.

- **Multi-Tenant Support** — Architect the system to isolate data and configurations per client, enabling SaaS deployments and ensuring data privacy.

- **Integration with Visualization Tools (Metabase, Superset, Grafana)** — Provide rich, interactive dashboards for business users and clinicians, enhancing data exploration without coding.

- **CI/CD Pipelines for Automated Testing and Deployment** — Ensure rapid and safe iteration cycles with automated tests, container builds, and deployment to Kubernetes or cloud environments.

## Limitations

- **No Authentication or Authorization** — The API is unsecured, suitable only for local demos. Production deployments require integration with identity providers and RBAC.

- **Unproven Production Scalability** — The system has not been load-tested for concurrent writes or high volume patient data, which may cause performance degradation or failures.

- **Lack of Horizontal Scalability** — Current architecture is monolithic and may not scale well horizontally; Kubernetes deployment is a step toward microservices and better scaling.

- **Static Schema Assumption** — Schema changes require manual migration; no support for dynamic schema evolution or versioning yet.

- **Synthetic Data Only** — The system currently uses mock data; real-world validation with actual patient data is necessary to ensure accuracy and compliance.

- **Local Data Persistence by Default** — Data is stored locally unless explicitly configured to use external storage, limiting durability and fault tolerance.

- **Scheduler Assumes System Time Sync** — Timing-based orchestrations depend on synchronized system clocks across services; lack of NTP or time drift handling could cause scheduling errors.



## CI/CD

This project is designed for local development. Deployment to cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, GCP) is out of scope but could be integrated with Terraform and CI pipelines.
